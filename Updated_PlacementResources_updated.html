### üá¨üáß United Kingdom ‚ñº
 
Very Difficult Post-Brexit 
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Brexit Alert
 
After Brexit, the UK government has made going to the UK very difficult, and potentially almost impossible! Ireland is a good alternative. 
Most organisations in the UK won't be able to sponsor your post-Brexit visa. You would need to be "Tier 5 authorised" - and that is a very short list.
#### Currently Approved Tier 5 Government Authorised Exchange Schemes (June 2021)
 
AIESEC 
Volunteer 
Run by students, with opportunities all over the world, though you may have to be flexible to find one that suits you as many of them (not all!) are business related. Affordable, but don't expect a lot of guidance. In the UK, these would usually be volunteer opportunities. 
Contact: AIESEC Utrecht branch for info - they may also give a presentation which will be posted under modules ‚Üí week 1 
BUNAC 
Paid Programs 
Old and well established, but pricey. 
[Visit BUNAC](https://bunac.org/) 
British Council - Modern Language Assistant 
Paid 
Great opportunity IF you happen to speak fluent French, German, Italian, Spanish, or Mandarin and IF your home country is on the list.

Castle Rock Hostel, Edinburgh

Update 2024: You are now allowed to volunteer for up to 30 days. If you have family in the UK you might want to consider staying with them.

For longer volunteering: [Charity Worker Visa info](https://www.gov.uk/temporary-worker-charity-worker-visa)

### üá∫üá∏ United States ‚ñº
 
J-1 Visa Required 
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Visa Warning
 
It is NOT always easy to get a visa for the US - students seem to usually need a J-1 visa for these placements. Before accepting a placement, discuss visas with the organization. Please don't volunteer on a tourist visa - it's VERY illegal! 
Consider Canada as an alternative - visas are sometimes easier to obtain or not needed, Canadians are famous for being friendly, and it's generally safer. 
Non-EU Passport? If you need an American visa and have a non-EU passport, make sure to ask us for a letter explaining you are travelling for your studies, as visas have been rejected for no apparent reason in the past! 
#### Our Recommendations - Summer Camps
 
Summer camps are (comparatively) easy to get visas for and look great on your CV. You will be kept very busy but you get paid and students almost always come back having loved their experience. 
During the course, we will introduce Camp Cobossee and our contact there. If you're interested after learning more about this camp in Maine, please tell your teacher after class and they'll tell you what to do next! The best time to start applying for a summer camp is December! 
Fresh Air Fund 
Paid Housing Included Highly Recommended 
This is a great camp in the United States. 
[Apply here](http://www.freshair.org/work-at-camp) 
CCUSA 
Paid Housing Included 
Summer camps in the US and Canada. We strongly recommend that you avoid the "work experience" option due to negative experiences in the past - summer camps, however, are recommended. 
[Visit CCUSA](http://www.ccusa.com/) 
Camp Leaders 
Paid Housing Included [Visit Camp Leaders](https://www.campleaders.com/ww)

- InterExchange: [www.interexchange.org](http://www.interexchange.org/)
### üá®üá¶ Canada ‚ñº
 
Easier than USA 
Great alternative to the USA! Visas may be easier to obtain. From large cities to spectacular national parks, Canada has something for everyone. Bear in mind that Quebec is French-speaking and therefore not an option for your Stay Abroad. 
Visa Information: [Check volunteer visa requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/educational-institutions/volunteer-work-conducted-foreign-students-when-work-permit-esdc-confirmation-required.html) 
Camp Canada 
Min. 1000 CAD guaranteed Housing Included 
Once you get matched, you can talk to the summer camp itself about your pay rate. 
Cost overview: [View costs and what's included](https://www.camp-canada.com/uk/how-it-works/costs-and-inclusions)Reddit discussion about costs: [Community feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/summercamp/comments/1bu43kr/comment/kzvc3py/) [Visit Camp Canada](https://www.campcanada.co.uk/) 
Ontario Camps (Direct Application) 
Higher Pay 
Look for camps in Ontario without a mediating company. This means no assistance with the VISA process, but once you have that figured out it should lead to you making more money than taking the mediating company route. If you want more assistance we do recommend you go with a company like Camp Canada, CCUSA, Camp America.

### üá¶üá∫üá≥üáø Australia & New Zealand ‚ñº
 
Working Holiday Visa 
Working Holiday visa required. You would likely need a Working Holiday visa, which you can use to get (low) paid backpacker-type jobs. Perhaps use the summer holidays as well as ten weeks is not a lot of time. 
Visa Information:
 Australia: [Working Holiday FAQ](https://www.australia.com/en/youth-travel/working-holiday-visa/faq.html)  [Short stay work visas](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/working-in-australia/short-stay-work-visas) New Zealand: [Working Holiday visa info](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/options/work/thinking-about-coming-to-new-zealand-to-work/working-holiday-visa) 
Tip: If you have a visa, you probably don't have to use an official organization. Since you will have the right to work, you should be able to just apply for jobs that you are interested in. Many people fly into Melbourne or Sydney and then apply for jobs from there. It's risky (financially), but it can be a lot of fun.

### üáøüá¶ South Africa ‚ñº
 
Research Required 
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning
 
You are NOT allowed to volunteer at an orphanage in South Africa. Here's why: [Say No to Orphanage Volunteering](https://www.savethechildren.ca/say-no-to-orphanage-volunteering/) 
Be careful about doing volunteer work in South Africa (carefully research the opportunities) as there are sometimes complaints due to volunteers taking on work that could be done by residents. 
Many of the opportunities in South Africa are ones that you either pay a lot of money for and/or that fall under 'voluntourism'. Please do your research carefully. 
GoEco 
Wildlife Conservation 
For people eager to travel and contribute to the community, wildlife and environment. They offer 26 projects in South Africa, ranging from 1-12 weeks, lots of wildlife. Be careful - there are also orphanage projects on here (which are harmful and therefore not allowed).

Au-pairing: Our students have not had the best experiences. If you do want to become an au-pair, go through an official company and check reviews. 
Seasonal farm work: Check reviews carefully. Some farms have poor sleeping conditions, little supervision, crazy hours, or no wifi.
